# shrekboards.github.io

Web application for modifying character attack values in Shrek SuperSlam.

Built using Vue 3, TypeScript, Materialize CSS and WebAssembly. This application serves
as a wrapper around the [shrek-superslam](https://github.com/ShrekBoards/shrek-superslam)
Rust crate, which is compiled to WASM and handles the heavy lifting of parsing and
reconstructing the files. A binary version of this application is available as an example
program in that repository.
